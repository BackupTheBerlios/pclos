PCLinuxOS instaler
-----------------

Since I am supposed to make a readme... here it is...

The idea is that you see this program when you boot the installer CD. 
This is useless ATM, and just displayed cut "graphics". 

The code which installs PCLinuxOS is called "install-pclos.sh". You can use that.

All code is LGPL unless it says so. Buh... I wanted to do this LGPL...
